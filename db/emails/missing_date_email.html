<p>Hi <strong>{{ shop.name }}</strong>,</p>
<p>We are letting you know that there was a problem processing order <a href="{{ order_url }}">{{ order.name }}</a>. We were
    unable to find a valid date associated with one or more line items in the order so no booking could be created.</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<p>
1. We recommend you <a href="{{ bta_url }}">create a booking manually in BTA</a> for this order so that the availability is accurate.<br/>
2.Check the order and ensure the date is shown as a line item property and is a valid date. A missing or
    invalid date indicates a problem with the BookThatApp installation. Please feel free to <a href="http://support.shopifyconcierge.com/tickets/new">contact us</a> for
    help troubleshooting installation issues.
</p>
<p>
    Kind Regards,<br/>
    Shopify Concierge
