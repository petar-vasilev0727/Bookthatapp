class Rack::Attack

  ### Configure Cache ###

  # If you don't want to use Rails.cache (Rack::Attack's default), then
  # configure it here.
  #
  # Note: The store is only used for throttling (not blacklisting and
  # whitelisting). It must implement .increment and .write like
  # ActiveSupport::Cache::Store

  # Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new

  ### Whitelist ###

  # Always allow requests from localhost
  # (blacklist & throttles are skipped)
  Rack::Attack.whitelist('allow from localhost and webhooks') do |req|
    # Requests are allowed if the return value is truthy
    '127.0.0.1' == req.ip || '::1' == req.ip || (req.path.starts_with?('/hooks/') && req.post?)
  end

  ### Blacklist ###

  # Block suspicious requests for '/etc/password' or wordpress specific paths.
  # After 3 blocked requests in 10 minutes, block all requests from that IP for 5 minutes.
  Rack::Attack.blacklist('fail2ban pentesters') do |req|
    # `filter` returns truthy value if request fails, or if it's from a previously banned IP
    # so the request is blocked
    Rack::Attack::Fail2Ban.filter("pentesters-#{req.ip}", :maxretry => 3, :findtime => 10.minutes, :bantime => 5.minutes) do
      # The count for the IP is incremented if the return value is truthy
      CGI.unescape(req.query_string) =~ %r{/etc/passwd} ||
          req.path.include?('/azenv.php') ||
          req.path.include?('/etc/passwd') ||
          req.path.include?('wp-admin') ||
          req.path.include?('wp-login')

    end
  end

  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('req/ip', :limit => 300, :period => 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.ip unless req.path.start_with?('/hooks/')
  end

  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # Throttle POST requests to /login by IP address
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:logins/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('logins/ip', :limit => 5, :period => 20.seconds) do |req|
    if req.path == '/sign_in' && req.post?
      req.ip
    end
  end

  ### Custom Throttle Response ###

  # By default, Rack::Attack returns an HTTP 429 for throttled responses,
  # which is just fine.
  #
  # If you want to return 503 so that the attacker might be fooled into
  # believing that they've successfully broken your app (or you just want to
  # customize the response), then uncomment these lines.
  # self.throttled_response = lambda do |env|
  #  [ 503,  # status
  #    {},   # headers
  #    ['']] # body
  # end
end
