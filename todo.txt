    When I go to product A's product page and select Mon then go to product B's product page
    Then the date and time fields on product B should have been reset.

- Scenario "Sets quantity to capacity minus max of existing bookings quantity for discrete bookings":
    Given someone is trying to book product A which a capcity of 5 for a range of 10 days and there are 2 discrete bookings of quantity 1 within that range
    When I go to product A and select a date range that overlaps the 2 bookings
    Then the quantity field max should be set to 4.
